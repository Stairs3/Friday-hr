December 15th Deliverable:
Layout
Header
Footer
2 Pages
Fix contract

Pages:
Home, New Member Info, Media, Calendar and Events, Competition History, Sponsor Info, About Us, Contact Us, Search Bar

Designs:
Colors: Royal Blue (65,105,225)
        Safety Green (241,250,61)
Signature Font: Bladerunner

Ideas:
Maybe add link to FIRST website? (firstinspires.org)
Team store link somewhere?
Link ALL sponsor logos to their own websites!!
Green banner text?
Add photos of each staff or one group photo
Add team photo of first team
Add team photo of current team
Need current member list
Make it so that the media page shows a lot of recent photos with a button that leads to another page with links to all the folders of old photos
Talk about what FRC is somewhere???
If we really wanted to get fancy we could add a page for each section of the team on the website like https://www.umatillarobotics.org/scouting 
make it so all photos follow a uniform naming system?
maybe change behavior of links on new member info page AND contact us page so they match the style of footer?

To-Do:
Clean up style sheet (I keep repeating the same text specifications over and over again T^T)
Figure out what sponsors go in the footer
Make footer mobile accessible
Attatch header and footer to every page with magic
