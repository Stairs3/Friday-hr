BANNER Ideas:

Team store link somewhere?
Link ALL sponsor logos to their own websites!!
Green banner text?
Add photos of each staff or one group photo
Add team photo of first team
Add team photo of current team
Need current member list
Make it so that the media page shows a lot of recent photos with a button that leads to another page with links to all the folders of old photos
Talk about what FRC is somewhere???
make it so all photos follow a uniform naming system?
maybe change behavior of links on new member info page AND contact us page so they match the style of footer?

To-Do:
Clean up style sheet (I keep repeating the same text specifications over and over again T^T)
Figure out what sponsors go in the footer

Make footer mobile accessible
Attatch header and footer to every page with magic
decide uniform layout for each page (same fonts, sizes, margins)
