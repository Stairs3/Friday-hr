Ideas:
Maybe add link to FIRST website? (firstinspires.org)
Team store link somewhere?
Link ALL sponsor logos to their own websites!!
Green banner text?
Add photos of each staff or one group photo
Add team photo of first team
Add team photo of current team
Need current member list
Make it so that the media page shows a lot of recent photos with a button that leads to another page with links to all the folders of old photos
Talk about what FRC is somewhere???
If we really wanted to get fancy we could add a page for each section of the team on the website like https://www.umatillarobotics.org/scouting 
make it so all photos follow a uniform naming system?
