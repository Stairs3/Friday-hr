<h1 style="text-align: center;">Our Beginning</h1>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-left:50px; margin-right: 50px;">Spearheaded by an enthusiastic assistant superintendent, a willing director, and two teachers that didn't know any better,
     the CTC Inspire Robotics team was founded in the Spring of 2015. With help from other local teams and FIRST regional mentors, 
     the team registered in the system as rookies with the Fort Osage School District as our home school. The team is housed and run at 
     the The Career and Technology Center at Fort Osage, the CTC receives students from 5 high schools for 14 different programs. These 
     schools include Fort Osage High School, Blue Springs High School, Blue Springs South High School, Grain Valley High School, and Oak 
     Grove High School. The robotics team is open to any student that attends the CTC (11 & 12th) or Fort Osage High School (9-12th).</p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-left:50px; margin-right: 50px;">As we began our rookie season in the 2016
     year we were very excited to participate in the Stronghold competition. The team was a small group of very
      persistent, intellectual, and determined students who were excited to compete in robotics competitions. 
      This was a team made up of all first year FIRST members; everyone had little to no experience with being 
      on a robotics team before. The team started with 20 members; 14 boys and 6 girls.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; margin-left:50px; margin-right: 50px;">We still hold true to the spark of our
     first season - the team is excited to learn more about FIRSTâ€™s mission. The students of the CTC Inspire
      team already value STEM skills and are eager to build self-confidence, communication and leadership 
      skills.</p>
